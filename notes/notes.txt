Genre Grouping with Priority Clusters:
Songs are grouped or loosely clustered based on dominant genre families (e.g., afro house, chill house, pop, future bass, etc.). Some genres appear prioritized (e.g., afro house, organic house) — likely based on either:

    A target mood/style of the playlist (e.g., house-heavy, pop-heavy)

    Manual or learned ranking of genre clusters

BPM Smoothing (Tempo Flow):
Within those clusters, songs are sorted to allow natural BPM transitions — usually:

    Ascending or gently fluctuating tempo

    BPM jumps are minimized for smoother transitions

Artist Variety Preference:
Songs by the same artist (e.g., multiple by Tate McRae) are spaced out to avoid repetition, unless stylistically appropriate.

Playlist Type Variation:
The three different outputs likely represent:

    Output 1: House-oriented blend → starts with afro house, organic house

    Output 2: R&B/rap-to-chill progression → starts with rap, ends with chill house

    Output 3: Pop-to-deep house buildup → mid-tempo pop, gradually ramps into house/electronic
